# SANS 3MinMax

Kevin Ripa  101

## 5 Windows Quick Win Artifacts

#### Registry 
- aka. hives: SAM,System,Software,Secrutiy,NTUser
- find what: MRU Lists, System searches, Browser typed URLs, USB/Wifi connection, SSIDs, Network connections, Programs/services running at startup, etc.
- https://github.com/EricZimmerman -> Registry Explorer.
- C:\Windows\system32\config\SAM
- popular: OpenSavePidIMRU, RecentDocs, SAM, USBSTOR, AppCompatCache, WordWheelQuery, ComputerName, TimeZoneInformation, CurrentVersion.
- Regeditor shows no information of SAM hive, but Registry Explorer shows the information.
- Transaction Logs: https://andreafortuna.org/2021/02/06/windows-registry-transaction-logs-in-forensic-analysis/

#### Jumplists 
- file, folder user performed historically.
- {userFile}\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Recent Items\AutomaticDestinations
- last folder above need to be input manually.
- "{appID}.automaticDestinations-ms" files
- jumplist explorer: "jlecmd -f {one-ms file path} "
- "jlecmd -f {one-ms file path}  --csv {output path}" output as csv.

#### ".LNK"
- {userFile}\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Recent Items
- files in above folder, are files interacted before.
- when date created same as date modified, mean opened once. Otherwise, more than once.
- real file has different time stamp, as file above is the shortcut`s timestamp.
- when real file deleted, link file still stays.
- ``` lecmd -f {linkFilePath} --csv {outPutPath} ``` or -d to directory.

#### Shellbags
- open a folder again, same location, same window size.
- {userFile}\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\UsrClass.dat
- HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Local Settings\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Shell
- ZM tool: ShellBags Explorer. ``` SBECmd.exe -l --csv {outPutPath} ```
- eg. F: may not be the same USB device, watch meta data to check.

#### Prefetch
- C:\Windows\Prefetch
- file name eg. CONHOST.EXE-0C6456FB.pf, MSEDGEWEBVIEW2.EXE-053FE714.pf
- ZM tool: ``` pecmd -f {.pf file path} ```
- ``` pecmd -d C:\Windows\Prefetch\ --csv C:\Temp1 -q```
- WinPrefetchView, www.nirsoft.net

## Bigger data
- NAS: network attached storage.
- RAID: Redundant Array of Independent(Inexpensive) Disks.
- RAID 5: maybe the most popular one. One drive lose is acceptable. Recover takes time. Use parity.
- synology, QNAP.

## Online evidence
- https://hunch.ly/
- https://www.aircrack-ng.org/ IP not sufficient -> device

## image Surface Pro
- only 3 ports: Power Interface, USB 3, mini Display.
- use USB 3 powered hub.
- connect: USB with boot program, hard drive(get image).
- UEFI screen. Boot to Paladin OS. 
- https://sumuri.com/paladin-manual/

## log
- c:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs
- gkape: https://ericzimmerman.github.io/KapeDocs/#!index.md
- EZ tool: Timeline Explorer.	
- Event Log Explorer. (filter)
- logon type: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/securing-privileged-access/reference-tools-logon-types
- Oalerts

## lies computer tolds
- LNK file: ftk imager can look at master file table(MFT), and show files, which Windows may not. (same file names, but some of them deleted)

## Volume Shadow Copy
- system->about->system protection
- ``` svvadmin list shadows /for=E: ```
- arsenal image mounter
- ShadowExplorer

## webcache
- Browser->Website Data Settings->Current Location.
- If you want to see it: 1. show hidden files. 2. (Not) Hide protected operating system files.

## Cellphone
- Do not turn off.
- Different kinds.

## password
- https://www.grc.com/haystack.htm
- cupp: wordlist builder
- Password Manager: Dashlane, Lastpass, Keypass, 1Password.

## data
- Bit: binary digit
- Byte: By eight
- nibble: 4 bits, one hex.

- https://www.youtube.com/@MagnetForensics1/videos; binaryforay.blogspot.com

## Kape
- Kroll Artifact Parser & Extractor
- target, executable, modules.
- GUI version: gkape.

## EZViewer
- If do not know how to handle a file, it will open in hex.
- right bottom, view in hex.

## Incorrected conclusion.
- MFT entry 2 - Deleted abc.dll -> Cluster 13.
- MFT entry 3 - Exists Koala.jpg -> Cluster 13.
- Then, MFT entry 3, Koala.jpg deleted, and points to Cluster 14 like abc.xlsx.
- wrong conclusion may be: some one hide Koala.jpg as abc.dll in a system directory.
- Because Entry and storage space have no relationship between each other.

# book: Practical Malware Analysis

## types
	- Backdoor, botnet, downloader, launcher, rootkit, scareware, spam, worm
	- persistence mechanism: windows registry

## static
	1. hash as a fingerprint.
	2. find strings
	3. detect packed and obfuscated malware
	4. linked library and functions
	5. PE file headers: meta data about the file

## Dynamic:
	1. source-level, assembly-level debug.
	2. kernel, user-mode debug.


## Process VS Service:
	- A process is an instance of a particular executable (.exe program file) running. 
	- A service is a process which runs in the background and does not interact with the desktop


## PE: magic number "MZ"
	1. PE Header
		metadata information, pointers, and links to address sections in memory. 
	2. PE Data Section
		.text stores the actual code of the program
		.data holds the initialized and defined variables
		.bss holds the uninitialized data (declared variables with no assigned values)
		.rdata contains the read-only data
		.edata: contains exportable objects and related table information
		.idata imported objects and related table information
		.reloc image relocation information
		.rsrc links external resources used by the program such as images, icons, embedded binaries, and manifest file, which has all information about program versions, authors, company, and copyright!

## AV Evasion:
	1. staged payload.
	2. packer. Packing and Obfuscation.
	3. Binder.
	4. Sandbox evasion. 

## Virtual memory:
	page virtual memory to the disk to slove: more virtual memory than physical memory allocated.

## Tools:
	- PEview
	- FSG packer
	- UPX packer
	- Dependency Walker
	- Resource Hacker
		To counter: resource section contains another PE executable.
		Use:save the resource as binary data, then analyze.
			click Action>Save resource as binary file.
	- downloader
		downloads additional malware
	- Regshot
		take a baseline snapshot of the registry


## Imports: (MSDN documentation)
	- type: networking, service-manipulation, registry-manipulation.

	- WS2_32.dll		-> network functionality
	- wininet.dll		-> F: InternetOpen, InternetOpenURL	-> connects to Internet
		InternetReadFile, InternetCloseHandle, InternetOpenUrlA, InternetOpenA
	- advapi32.dll	-> permissions

	- kernel32.dll	-> F: FindFirstFile, FindNextFile	 -> filesystem(modify files)
	- kernel32.dll	-> F: CreateProcess, Sleep			 -> backdoors
	- kernel32.dll	-> F: CreateFile, WriteFile, WinExec -> write to disk & execute
	- kernel32.dll	-> F: LoadResource, FindResource	 -> loads data from resource section 

	- CreateFileA, CreateFileMappingA, and MapViewOfFile -> probably opens a file and maps it into memory.
	- LoadLibrary, or GetProcAddress -> load DLL and use its function at runtime.

## Exports: mostly for DLL
	- ServiceMain 	-> malware needs to be installed as a service.
		svchost.exe: a shared-service process that serves as a shell for loading services from DLL files.
	- rundll32: can run DLL with exports.

## Use of mutex
	only one copy of the program is running at a time.

## Dynamic analysis...

#### Before run malware:
	- run procmon
	- start Process Explorer
	- set up virtual network (including ApateDNS, Netcat, Wireshark)
#### Run malware:
	- In Process Explorer: 
		Handlers: may find Mutant.
		Dlls.
	- procmon filter process actions:
		need to filter out a certain amount of noise.
		find if it: RegSetValue, WriteFile.
			write file to copy itself.
			modify register to run on system startup.
#### Check ApateDNS
		if malware performed DNS requests.
#### Check netcat
		find what the malware requested.

## IDA Pro DLL
	- Start from DllMain
		all code that executes from the DllEntryPoint until DllMain has likely been generated by the compiler
	- CTRL-X with the cursor on gethostbyname: check cross-references.
	- byte_ prefix: IDA believes a one byte variable.
	- off_ prefix: a pointer variable.
	- Rabit hole: IDA may fail to label function like printf, and you may lost in it.

- Virtual memory: VMWare - .vmem; Hyper-V - .bin; Parallels - .mem; VirtualBox - .sav file.
- imageinfo: list best possible OS profiles
- ``` python3 vol.py -f dump.vmem windows.info ``` use plugin windows.info to get information from dump.vmem.
- ``` python3 vol.py -f <file> windows.pslist ``` listing processes. Can not see unlinked rootkits.
- ``` python3 vol.py -f <file> windows.psscan ``` help combat evasion techniques above.

- SSDT Hooks, IRP Hooks, IAT Hooks, EAT Hooks, Inline Hooks.
- SSDT: System Service Descriptor Table. modify pointers to a location the rootkit controls.
- ``` python3 vol.py -f <file> windows.ssdt ```

#### find driver files as part of their evasion
- ``` python3 vol.py -f <file> windows.modules ``` dump a list of loaded kernel modules
- ``` python3 vol.py -f <file> windows.driverscan ``` identify driver files in the kernel, which "modules" may miss

- Ntds. dit: a database that stores Active Directory data. (hashcat: can get the credentials)
- application event ID 216: move Nsds.dit database, caused by volumn shadow copy, no worry.

## Registry
- https://dfir.ru/2020/10/03/exporting-registry-hives-from-a-live-system/ 
- some may only stay in memory, others on disk as hive.
- system hives: C:\Windows\System32\config, DEFAULT; SAM; SECURITY; SOFTWARE; SYSTEM.
- HKEY_CURRENT_USER: NTUSR.DAT; usrClass.dat.
- C:\Windows\appcompat\Programs\Amcache.hve
- https://www.13cubed.com/downloads/windows_registry_cheat_sheet.pdf
- keys and subkeys have last write time; but values in it do not have.
- shellbag: even delete the path, shellbag still exists.
- HKLM/SYSTEM/Select(current) -> check which control set is using. 
- https://github.com/EricZimmerman/RECmd/blob/master/BatchExamples/Kroll_Batch.reb (filter out potentially irrelevant information from the Windows Registry)
- regripper: another tool

## Evidence of Execution
- two major type: 1. user experience. 2. backwards compatibility.

#### prefetch
- user experience
- prefetch: speed up app start up. (monitor app for around 10 seconds, to see the resources it needs.)
- GUI or CMD.
- C:\Windows\Prefetch
- name: {appName}-{8digitsHash}.pf    
- different hash may means same exe name in different locations or with different parameters.
- sometimes parameters in hash calculation, not always.
- created time -> first execute; modified time -> last execute.
- default on desktop windows, not server.
- last 8 time of execution is tracked in pf file, since windows 8.
- 32-bit app runs on 64-bit system, not reverse. so malware authors use 32-bit. at: windows/SysWOW64. 2 CMD pf files, one 32-bit.
- ZM tool: PECmd.exe
- after delete binary, prefetch still exists.
- anti-forensic: delete prefetch. ``` sdelete *.pf ``` delete all prefetch.
- sdelete-hash.pf left, in PECmd.exe, in "file referenced", we can know what it deleted.

#### Shimcache
- backwards compatibility
- HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\AppCompatCache
- used to be evidence of execution, before windows 10, not in windows 10/newer.
- the higher on the list, the more recent it shimed.
- same modified time, may mean same file just with different name.(eg. find renamed malware)
- files viewd in window explorer, will be in the cache. NOT only when executed.
- reboot computer will refresh shimcache.
- ZM: AppCompatCacheParser.exe

#### AmCache
- https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/2019/01/anssi-coriin_2019-analysis_amcache.pdf
- C:\Windows\appcompat\Programs\Amcache.hve
- contain many program metadata. linkdate(compilation date)
- can not use to proof execution.
- InventoryApplication, InventoryApplicationFile, InventoryDriverBinary.
- ZM: AmcacheParser.exe

#### PCA (Program Compatibility Assistant)
- very new, Windows 11 22H2
- C:\Windows\appcompat\pca\PcaAppLaunchDic.txt

#### MUICache
- HKCU\Software\Classes\Local Settings\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Shell\MuiCache
- ApplicationCompany, FriendlyAppName. (rename exe do not change them)
- no MRU list, so no timestamp info.
- per user artifact for gui program.

#### UserAssist Registry
- Run counter, Focus Count.
- https://imphash.medium.com/userassist-with-a-pinch-of-salt-as-an-evidence-of-execution-4dc4e9640a77 

#### SRUM
- System Resource Utilization Monitor
- C:\Windows\System32\sru\SRUDB.dat
- ZM: SrumECmd.exe
